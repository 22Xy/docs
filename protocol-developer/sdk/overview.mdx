The protocol provides an open source implementation of SDKs that allows developers to build application on Galxe protocol. The SDK provides:

1. Credential maker function: generate a credential based on its type.
2. BabyZK verification stack
   1. circuit generator: generate circom code based on type definition.
   2. signer: Sign a credential with private key.
   3. proof generator: Generate a proof based on the type and conditions.
   4. proof verifier: Based on the credential type, query verification key from blockchain and return the verification result. Users should always use the SDKâ€™s proof verifiers or on-chain verifiers, when possible to enable type-based security checks.
