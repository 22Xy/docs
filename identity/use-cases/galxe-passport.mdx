## Type

"Galxe Passport v2" credential type is registered onchain as a custom primitive type with type ID 10000. See type definition and more details [here](/identity/specification/primitive-types)

## Issurance Workflow

Once user passes KYC verification with Persona, our KYC provider, upon user request, Galxe backend will:

1. Retrieve all necessary personal identifiable information to issue a Galxe Passport credential
2. Generate credential using pre-defined type
3. Append the following information as attachments:
   - first_name
   - last_name
   - id_number: user's government ID number
   - passport_version: v2.0 for now
   - persona_id: unique identifier that serves as the only mapping of user's wallet to KYC data stored in Persona
   - nationality: if provided by user's government ID
4. Galxe-managed issuer sign the credential and its attachments, then add both signatures to the credential
5. Return the signed credential back to user, and user will encrypt it with their own passport.
6. User store the encrypted file in their preferred storage. For now, user will use Galxe Vault for storage with no charge
