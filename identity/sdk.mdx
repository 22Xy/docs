## About the SDK

The Galxe Identity Protocol TypeScript SDK empowers developers to:

+ Design new ZK credential types using our domain-specific language (Type DSL), without requiring any knowledge of zero-knowledge proofs.
+ Issue ZKP-powered credentials.
+ Generate zero-knowledge proofs.
+ Interact with on-chain contracts for tasks such as issuer registration, context registration, and proof verification.
+ Most of the gadgets you would need, if not everything.

## Code Repository

All source code can be found in our monorepo on GitHub: [Galxe Identity Protocol](https://github.com/Galxe/identity-protocol).

## SDK Installation

Install the SDK using npm, Yarn, or pnpm with the following commands:

- **npm**
  ```bash
  npm install @galxe-identity-protocol/sdk
  ```

- **pnpm**
  ```bash
  pnpm add @galxe-identity-protocol/sdk
  ```

- **Yarn**
  ```bash
  yarn add @galxe-identity-protocol/sdk
  ```

## EVM Contracts in Solidity

For developers aiming to integrate or directly interact with our EVM contracts, refer to the code and documentation available here: [EVM Contracts](https://github.com/Galxe/identity-protocol/tree/main/packages/evm-contracts).

## Issuer gRPC Service

For those planning to serve as issuers, we provide a Node.js (written in TypeScript) gRPC service and a Dockerfile. This can be deployed as a microservice in your infrastructure to facilitate credential issuance to users. Learn more and access the service here: [Issuer Service](https://github.com/Galxe/identity-protocol/tree/main/apps/issuer).
