title: "Stateful Verifier"

Besides using the verifier contract, that is associated with the credential type, to verify the validity of zero-knowledge proof, a full verification requires additional on-chain state validations, including:

1. Do type and context matches verifier ºs expectation?
2. Can the revealed credential expiration lower bound prove that the credential is not expired? (greater or equal to the current blocktime)
3. Is the public key still active for the expected issuer?
4. If the credential is revocable, is the proof generated with the current SMT root?

For Babyzk, we built a contract that does all the checks in a simple function call verifyProofFull , so that verifiers can validate a proof with just one function call. It supports both:

- Static Verification: Checks the validity of proofs without considering the state of the issuer's public key or revocation lists.
- Full Verification: Extends static verification by also checking the issuer's public key activity and whether the revocation tree check is up-to-date.
