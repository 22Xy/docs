Smart contracts in the protocol serve two primary functions:

**On-chain Data Storage:**

- Context registry
- Issuer registry
  - Metadata
  - Public key management
  - Revocable credential state management
- Type registry
  - Primitive type management Metadata
  - Definition
  - Resource URI Static proof verifier Public input parser
- Trust schema

**On-chain Verification:**

- Stateful credential zk verifier contract
- Aggregated on-chain attestation

The Galxe identity protocol is crafted to be chain-agnostic, with plans to deploy these smart contracts across various EVM-compatible chains, including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and several Layer 2 solutions.
